Please email eoi.gaspipeline@nt.gov.au to request a copy of the EOI.   Background The Northern Territory Government is working to facilitate the development of a gas pipeline connection from the Territory to meet energy demands on the eastern seaboard and to contribute to national energy security.  The Northern Territory Government has granted Major Project Status to the proposed gas pipeline linking the Territory and East Coast gas grids and will now begin a formal search for proponents to build, own and operate the pipeline.  “The construction of this gas pipeline is an infrastructure project of national significance. It’s also a matter of urgency for the eastern states which are fast approaching an energy security crisis,” Chief Minister Adam Giles said.

COAG agreed that connecting these gas markets is the next step to developing a national gas grid and will contribute to the development of a more national and competitive domestic gas market, helping to improve supply security.  It is estimated that the Territory has more than 200 trillion cubic feet of unconventional gas resources in six onshore basins and 30 trillion cubic feet of conventional offshore reserves.  Interest in the pipeline project is growing with more than 100 people attending an industry briefing in Alice Springs at the end of last month.

The plan is endorsed by both the Victorian and South Australian governments, local governments and major industry and transport organisations operating within  the Green Triangle region.     There is an estimated $8.7 billion worth of private investment set to commence within the Green Triangle region over the next five years in the mining, timber, energy, agriculture and dairy industries. It is critical that the right infrastructure exists for communities to benefit from this export driven growth and the job opportunities that it creates. Many of  the new investments will be in new and emerging sectors including low emissions thermal power, wave energy and natural gas - helping to strengthen the region’s economy in a carbon constrained future.  The Green Triangle Region Freight Action Plan outlines the significant export and employment opportunities in the region over the next decade and beyond and the need for infrastructure upgrades to the value of $340 million to accommodate the growing freight task.  The Green Triangle Region Freight Action Plan identifies critical strategic actions required to accommodate freight export growth in the areas of: • Road network enhancements • Rail network enhancements • Regulatory reform • Job opportunities and skills training • Community development Transport infrastructure and port handling facilities upgrades are critical to the implementation of this plan. Federal government funding is required for these national building projects.  The new investments scheduled for the region will generate 5,400 construction jobs and up to 1,000 direct jobs in the blue gum timber industry alone, with a further 1,000 additional jobs in industry associated with the timber industry. Blue gum wood chip exports through the Port of Portland will double, the $34 million South West Fibre static chip mill at Myamyn has commenced chipping operations and the Plantation Energy biofuel plant is due for construction at Heywood during 2010. Key export markets in the region include: • 25% of Australia’s dairy product • 17% of Australia’s plantation, forestry and wood processing • Significant heavy mineral exploration within the Murray Basin • 1 million tons of annual grain exports through the Port of Portland • 67,000 tons of livestock exports through the Port of Portland • Major industry exporting from the Port of Portland including Portland Aluminium (Victoria’s largest exporter by dollar value) With trade volumes through the Port of Portland projected to double to 7 million tons over the next five to ten years, the Port of Portland will become Australia’s largest wood chip export port. Increased exports will require an additional 75 ships through the port each year. This export growth (the port currently delivers $1.5 billion annually into the regional economy) will be a significant economic driver for the region.

Indkøbet er en del af DONG Energy's strategi om at få leveret hovedparten af vores entreprenør- og serviceydelser fra få faste leverandører. Disse faste leverandører skal alle kunne levere alle typer af ydelser, og således også koordinere og styre de nødvendige fagentrepriser. Denne udbudsbekendtgørelse udsendes efter en forudgående RFI-aktivitet annonceret på www.udbud.dk Indkøbet har som formål at udvælge 2 faste partnere og en fast projektpartner. De 2 faste partnere tildeles ydelser omfattet af tilbudslisten, ud fra en fordelingsmodel. Partnerne indgår i et partnerskab med DONG Energy omkring ydelserne. Projektpartneren indgår sammen med de 2 faste partnere i særlige partnerudbud, der omfatter ydelser udenfor tilbudslisten, men ligeledes omfattet af vilkår under rammeaftalen. Indholdet af rammeaftalen: Rammeaftalen omfatter hovedparten af de ydelser som DONG Energy indkøber i relation til etablering, drift og vedligehold af selskabets el-distributionsanlæg placeret i Storkøbenhavn og i Nordsjælland eller hvis der løses opgaver for andre selskaber. Rammeaftalen udgør en central del af DONG Energy's strategi omkring en mere simpel og effektiv samlet opgaveløsning samtidigt med et stort fokus på sikkerhed og kvalitet. DONG Energy's el-distributionsanlæg udgøres af spændingsniveauer fra 0,4 kV til 50 kV (der indgår enkelte ydelser vedr. 132 kV anlæg). Disse anlæg består af stationsanlæg, transformere, kabler og luftledninger med tilhørende bygninger, kommunikationsforbindelser og lokale kontrolanlæg. En væsentlig del af opgaverne indeholder ydelser i relation til grave- og belægningsarbejde ved arbejde med kabelanlæg. Rammeaftalen erstatter hovedparten af DONG Energy's nuværende rammeaftaler, underhåndsudbud og EU udbud indenfor rammeaftalens ydelsesomfang. Enkelte sådanne udbud vil fortsat blive anvendt på større aktiviteter, der har en særlig karakter. Disse udbud vil ligge udenfor denne rammeaftale. Processen for udbuddet: Udbudsprocessen er udbud med forhandling uden forudgående prækvalifikation. Tidsplanen for udbuddet op til aflevering af tilbud ser ud som følger: 26.8.2014 — forventet Informationsmøde om udbudsbekendtgørelsen — tilmelding nødvendig til kontaktpunktet jf. I.1) 26.9.2014 — udbudsbetingelserne forventes klar til udsendelse — anmodning om fremsendelse kan ske med det samme til kontaktpunktet jf. I.1) 29.9.2014 — forventet informationsmøde om udbudsbetingelserne — tilmelding nødvendig til kontaktpunktet jf. I.1) 25.10.2014 — frist for anmodning om fremsendelse af udbudsbetingelserne jf. IV.3.3) 7.11.2014 kl. 12:00 — tilbudsfrist jf. IV.3.4). Krav til tilbudsgiverne: Jf. afsnit III) i denne bekendtgørelse er der opstillet en række krav til tilbudsgiverne. Listen er ikke udtømmende og indeholder en række essentielle krav til den virksomhedstype som forventes at afgive tilbud. Komplet kravliste/kravspecifikation vil fremgå af udbudsbetingelserne, herunder mindstekrav. Spørgsmål og svar: I perioden før udbudsbetingelserne er tilgængelige opfordres interesserede til at melde sig til vores spørgsmål og svar liste, så der er mulighed for at følge de svar der gives på spørgsmål til udbudsbekendtgørelsen. Stilles der et spørgsmål, bliver afsender automatisk påført som modtager af listen. Eventuelle spørgsmål kan ikke forventes besvaret i juli måned. I perioden efter udbudsbetingelserne er tilgængelige er det kun de rekvirerende af udbudsbetingelserne, der vil få tilsendt listen med spørgsmål og svar. Spørgsmål og svar vil blive anonymiseret.

Et centralt element i rammeaftalen vil være et partnerskab mellem DONG Energy, og hver af de faste partnere, omkring et tæt og forpligtende samarbejde over kontraktperioden bygget op omkring en række målsætninger. Partnerskabet har som mål; markant at forbedre personsikkerhed, fastholde høj kvalitet samt at sikre en mere effektiv opgaveløsning gennem optimering af opgavefordeling, opgaveløsning, metoder og løsningsvalg. Partner målsætningerne indfries gennem et samarbejde om løbende at forbedre opgaveudførelsen og sænke omkostningsniveauet hen over rammeaftaleperioden. Rammeaftalen vil forudsætte en fast samarbejdsorganisation, der kan sikre løbende dialog og fokus på udvikling af partnerskabet. Kontrakten vil definere 3 typer af ydelser; 1) Primære ydelser omfatter el teknisk arbejde på de nævnte spændingsniveauer, som beskrevet i afsnit II.1.5), samt relateret jord- og belægningsarbejde. Aktiviteterne vil fremgå af udbudsbetingelserne. 2) Sekundære ydelser omfatter f.eks. alle former for bygningsarbejde, konstruktionsarbejde og arealpleje mv. Aktiviteterne vil fremgå af udbudsbetingelserne. 3) Tertiære ydelser omfatter fremtidige ydelser, som partneren kunne tænkes at levere fremadrettet. Det kan være indenfor områder, hvor DONG Energy som hovedregel selv er opgaveløser, men hvor en optimal opgaveløsning, set med udgangspunkt i rammeaftalens ydelser, berettiger til at partneren fremadrettet løser en større del af den samlede opgave. Eksempelvis kunne dette være en øget koordineringsopgave, projektering af nyanlæg, ændringer i anlæg samt dokumentation af disse ydelser. For de faste ydelser jf. nedenstående vil kontrakten omfatte incitamenter til gode præstationer indenfor kvalitet, arbejdsmiljø, sikkerhed og miljø (QHSE) og i forhold til løbende effektivisering af opgaveløsningen. De 2 faste partnere tildeles faste opgavepakker ud fra en fordelingsmodel dækket af rammeaftalens ydelsesbeskrivelser. Opgavepakker vil dække over såvel løbende opgaver, som specifikke projekttillægsopgaver. De 2 partnere skal begge kunne stå for leverancen af samtlige ydelser. Overdragelse af opgavepakkerne vil ske tidligst muligt og partneren vil blive indraget i den tidsmæssige planlægning for den enkelte opgaves udførelse. Partneren byder faste enhedspriser på de beskrevne ydelser. Leverancen afregnes direkte efter tilbudslisten, evt. med tillæg af supplerende ydelser nødvendige for den samlede opgaveløsning. Ydelser, der ikke på forhånd kan beskrives fuldstændigt, i de faste ydelsesbeskrivelser, vil blive indkøbt efter gennemførelse af et partnerudbud. Her udbydes ydelsen til de 2 faste partnere og en fast tredje projektpartner under rammeaftalens betingelser og aftalevilkår. Projektpartneren tildeles alene ydelser ved at deltage i partnerudbud. Udbud tænkes over tid at blive gennemført som et funktionsudbud. Estimated value excluding VAT: 1 200 000 000 DKK II.2.2) Information about options Options: yes Description of these options: Forlængelse med 3 x 1 år. II.2.3) Information about renewals This contract is subject to renewal: no II.3) Duration of the contract or time limit for completion Starting 1.4.2015 Completion 31.3.2020 Section III: Legal, economic, financial and technical information  III.1) Conditions relating to the contract III.1.1) Deposits and guarantees required: Der vil blive stillet krav om garantistillelse på entrepriser under rammeaftalen — dette vil fremgå af udbudsbetingelserne. III.1.2) Main financing conditions and payment arrangements and/or reference to the relevant provisions governing them: Vil fremgå af udbudsbetingelserne. III.1.3) Legal form to be taken by the group of economic operators to whom the contract is to be awarded: Der kræves ingen særlig retlig form af den økonomiske aktør. Det kan være nødvendigt for leverandøren at deltage i en sammenslutning, og samarbejde for at løfte rammeaftalens samlede ydelser. Af hensyn til sikring af konkurrencen og overholdelse af ligebehandlingsprincippet stilles der krav om, at en aktør eller deltager i en sammenslutning eller underentreprenør indenfor primære ydelser kun er repræsenteret én gang i forhold til denne udbudsbekendtgørelse. Dette vil blive uddybet nærmere i udbudsbetingelserne. Såfremt den økonomiske aktør består af en sammenslutning (f.eks. et konsortium eller Joint Venture mv.), skal sammenslutningen: — påtage sig solidarisk hæftelse — udpege en befuldmægtiget repræsentant, som skal være ordregivers kontaktperson. — levere dokumentation for at deltagerne er juridisk forpligtet af sammenslutningen.

Indkøbet er en del af DONG Energy's strategi om at få leveret hovedparten af vores entreprenør- og serviceydelser fra få faste leverandører. Disse faste leverandører skal alle kunne levere alle typer af ydelser, og således også koordinere og styre de nødvendige fagentrepriser. Denne udbudsbekendtgørelse udsendes efter en forudgående RFI-aktivitet annonceret på www.udbud.dk Indkøbet har som formål at udvælge 2 faste partnere og en fast projektpartner. De 2 faste partnere tildeles ydelser omfattet af tilbudslisten, ud fra en fordelingsmodel. Partnerne indgår i et partnerskab med DONG Energy omkring ydelserne. Projektpartneren indgår sammen med de 2 faste partnere i særlige partnerudbud, der omfatter ydelser udenfor tilbudslisten, men ligeledes omfattet af vilkår under rammeaftalen. Indholdet af rammeaftalen: Rammeaftalen omfatter hovedparten af de ydelser som DONG Energy indkøber i relation til etablering, drift og vedligehold af selskabets el-distributionsanlæg placeret i Storkøbenhavn og i Nordsjælland eller hvis der løses opgaver for andre selskaber. Rammeaftalen udgør en central del af DONG Energy's strategi omkring en mere simpel og effektiv samlet opgaveløsning samtidigt med et stort fokus på sikkerhed og kvalitet. DONG Energy's el-distributionsanlæg udgøres af spændingsniveauer fra 0,4 kV til 50 kV (der indgår enkelte ydelser vedr. 132 kV anlæg). Disse anlæg består af stationsanlæg, transformere, kabler og luftledninger med tilhørende bygninger, kommunikationsforbindelser og lokale kontrolanlæg. En væsentlig del af opgaverne indeholder ydelser i relation til grave- og belægningsarbejde ved arbejde med kabelanlæg. Rammeaftalen erstatter hovedparten af DONG Energy's nuværende rammeaftaler, underhåndsudbud og EU udbud indenfor rammeaftalens ydelsesomfang. Enkelte sådanne udbud vil fortsat blive anvendt på større aktiviteter, der har en særlig karakter. Disse udbud vil ligge udenfor denne rammeaftale. Processen for udbuddet: Udbudsprocessen er udbud med forhandling uden forudgående prækvalifikation. Tidsplanen for udbuddet op til aflevering af tilbud ser ud som følger: 26.8.2014 — forventet Informationsmøde om udbudsbekendtgørelsen — tilmelding nødvendig til kontaktpunktet jf. I.1) 26.9.2014 — udbudsbetingelserne forventes klar til udsendelse — anmodning om fremsendelse kan ske med det samme til kontaktpunktet jf. I.1) 29.9.2014 — forventet informationsmøde om udbudsbetingelserne — tilmelding nødvendig til kontaktpunktet jf. I.1) 25.10.2014 — frist for anmodning om fremsendelse af udbudsbetingelserne jf. IV.3.3) 7.11.2014 kl. 12:00 — tilbudsfrist jf. IV.3.4). Krav til tilbudsgiverne: Jf. afsnit III) i denne bekendtgørelse er der opstillet en række krav til tilbudsgiverne. Listen er ikke udtømmende og indeholder en række essentielle krav til den virksomhedstype som forventes at afgive tilbud. Komplet kravliste/kravspecifikation vil fremgå af udbudsbetingelserne, herunder mindstekrav. Spørgsmål og svar: I perioden før udbudsbetingelserne er tilgængelige opfordres interesserede til at melde sig til vores spørgsmål og svar liste, så der er mulighed for at følge de svar der gives på spørgsmål til udbudsbekendtgørelsen. Stilles der et spørgsmål, bliver afsender automatisk påført som modtager af listen. Eventuelle spørgsmål kan ikke forventes besvaret i juli måned. I perioden efter udbudsbetingelserne er tilgængelige er det kun de rekvirerende af udbudsbetingelserne, der vil få tilsendt listen med spørgsmål og svar. Spørgsmål og svar vil blive anonymiseret.

Et centralt element i rammeaftalen vil være et partnerskab mellem DONG Energy, og hver af de faste partnere, omkring et tæt og forpligtende samarbejde over kontraktperioden bygget op omkring en række målsætninger. Partnerskabet har som mål; markant at forbedre personsikkerhed, fastholde høj kvalitet samt at sikre en mere effektiv opgaveløsning gennem optimering af opgavefordeling, opgaveløsning, metoder og løsningsvalg. Partner målsætningerne indfries gennem et samarbejde om løbende at forbedre opgaveudførelsen og sænke omkostningsniveauet hen over rammeaftaleperioden. Rammeaftalen vil forudsætte en fast samarbejdsorganisation, der kan sikre løbende dialog og fokus på udvikling af partnerskabet. Kontrakten vil definere 3 typer af ydelser; 1) Primære ydelser omfatter el teknisk arbejde på de nævnte spændingsniveauer, som beskrevet i afsnit II.1.5), samt relateret jord- og belægningsarbejde. Aktiviteterne vil fremgå af udbudsbetingelserne. 2) Sekundære ydelser omfatter f.eks. alle former for bygningsarbejde, konstruktionsarbejde og arealpleje mv. Aktiviteterne vil fremgå af udbudsbetingelserne. 3) Tertiære ydelser omfatter fremtidige ydelser, som partneren kunne tænkes at levere fremadrettet. Det kan være indenfor områder, hvor DONG Energy som hovedregel selv er opgaveløser, men hvor en optimal opgaveløsning, set med udgangspunkt i rammeaftalens ydelser, berettiger til at partneren fremadrettet løser en større del af den samlede opgave. Eksempelvis kunne dette være en øget koordineringsopgave, projektering af nyanlæg, ændringer i anlæg samt dokumentation af disse ydelser. For de faste ydelser jf. nedenstående vil kontrakten omfatte incitamenter til gode præstationer indenfor kvalitet, arbejdsmiljø, sikkerhed og miljø (QHSE) og i forhold til løbende effektivisering af opgaveløsningen. De 2 faste partnere tildeles faste opgavepakker ud fra en fordelingsmodel dækket af rammeaftalens ydelsesbeskrivelser. Opgavepakker vil dække over såvel løbende opgaver, som specifikke projekttillægsopgaver. De 2 partnere skal begge kunne stå for leverancen af samtlige ydelser. Overdragelse af opgavepakkerne vil ske tidligst muligt og partneren vil blive indraget i den tidsmæssige planlægning for den enkelte opgaves udførelse. Partneren byder faste enhedspriser på de beskrevne ydelser. Leverancen afregnes direkte efter tilbudslisten, evt. med tillæg af supplerende ydelser nødvendige for den samlede opgaveløsning. Ydelser, der ikke på forhånd kan beskrives fuldstændigt, i de faste ydelsesbeskrivelser, vil blive indkøbt efter gennemførelse af et partnerudbud. Her udbydes ydelsen til de 2 faste partnere og en fast tredje projektpartner under rammeaftalens betingelser og aftalevilkår. Projektpartneren tildeles alene ydelser ved at deltage i partnerudbud. Udbud tænkes over tid at blive gennemført som et funktionsudbud. Estimated value excluding VAT: 1 200 000 000 DKK II.2.2) Information about options Options: yes Description of these options: Forlængelse med 3 x 1 år. II.2.3) Information about renewals This contract is subject to renewal: no II.3) Duration of the contract or time limit for completion Starting 1.4.2015 Completion 31.3.2020 Section III: Legal, economic, financial and technical information  III.1) Conditions relating to the contract III.1.1) Deposits and guarantees required: Der vil blive stillet krav om garantistillelse på entrepriser under rammeaftalen — dette vil fremgå af udbudsbetingelserne. III.1.2) Main financing conditions and payment arrangements and/or reference to the relevant provisions governing them: Vil fremgå af udbudsbetingelserne. III.1.3) Legal form to be taken by the group of economic operators to whom the contract is to be awarded: Der kræves ingen særlig retlig form af den økonomiske aktør. Det kan være nødvendigt for leverandøren at deltage i en sammenslutning, og samarbejde for at løfte rammeaftalens samlede ydelser. Af hensyn til sikring af konkurrencen og overholdelse af ligebehandlingsprincippet stilles der krav om, at en aktør eller deltager i en sammenslutning eller underentreprenør indenfor primære ydelser kun er repræsenteret én gang i forhold til denne udbudsbekendtgørelse. Dette vil blive uddybet nærmere i udbudsbetingelserne. Såfremt den økonomiske aktør består af en sammenslutning (f.eks. et konsortium eller Joint Venture mv.), skal sammenslutningen: — påtage sig solidarisk hæftelse — udpege en befuldmægtiget repræsentant, som skal være ordregivers kontaktperson. — levere dokumentation for at deltagerne er juridisk forpligtet af sammenslutningen. Virksomhedsoplysninger skal fremsendes for hver enkelt af deltagerne i sammenslutningen og ved brug af underentreprenører indenfor de primære ydelser defineret i afsnit II.2.1). III.1.4) Other particular conditions: The performance of the contract is subject to particular conditions: no III.2) Conditions for participation III.2.1) Personal situation of economic operators, including requirements relating to enrolment on professional or trade registers Information and formalities necessary for evaluating if the requirements are met: Tilbudsgiverne skal vedlægge tilbuddet en erklæring på tro og love om, at de ikke befinder sig i en af de i udbudsdirektivets artikel 45, stk. 2, opregnede situationer. Tilbudsgiverne bedes bekræfte, at tilbudsgiverne: a) ikke er under konkurs, likvidation, skifte eller tvangsakkord uden for konkurs, ikke har indstillet sin erhvervsvirksomhed eller befinder sig i en lignende situation i henhold til en tilsvarende procedure, der er fastsat i national lovgivning b) ikke er begæret taget under konkursbehandling eller behandling med henblik på likvidation, skifte eller tvangsakkord uden for konkurs eller enhver tilsvarende behandling, der er fastsat i national lovgivning c) ikke ved en retskraftig dom ifølge landets retsforskrifter er dømt for en strafbar handling, der rejser tvivl om den pågældendes faglige hæderlighed d) ikke i forbindelse med udøvelsen af sit erhverv har begået en alvorlig fejl, som de ordregivende myndigheder bevisligt har konstateret e) har opfyldt sine forpligtelser med hensyn til betaling af bidrag til sociale sikringsordninger i henhold til retsforskrifterne i det land, hvor den pågældende er etableret, eller i den ordregivende myndigheds land f) har opfyldt sine forpligtelser med hensyn til betaling af skatter og afgifter i henhold til retsforskrifterne i det land, hvor den pågældende er etableret, eller i den ordregivende myndigheds land.

A natural, high-purity, non-caloric product, Reb-A has a negligible effect on blood glucose; hence, it is attractive as a natural sweetener for diabetics and greatly beneficial to people on carbohydrate-controlled diets.

The development objective of the project is to provide support for the Government of Saint Lucia to make an informed decision regarding geothermal exploration and development in Saint Lucia by undertaking upstream preparatory activities.  Such support would help the Government of Saint Lucia confirm areas for drilling, partner with a qualified developer, and design a geothermal exploration/resource confirmation program for sustainable implementation – all in line with good industry practices and international standards. The project will include the following components: Component 1: Upstream geothermal development preparation and project management.This component will aim at advancing surface level reconnaissance that is necessary to determine whether several areas identified maybe suitable for geothermal exploration within the Qualibou region.  It will also include a review of previous analysis such as geological, geophysical and geochemical surveys, as well as available data from previously drilled wells. The component will also initiate environmental and social evaluations, including stakeholder consultations, to ascertain baseline conditions and the steps that may be necessary to mitigate any impacts so that geothermal can be developed in a safe and sustainable manner. Funding will also be applied towards technical advisory support to coordinate the technical assessments and integrate the results in a pre-feasibility study. Funding will also be allocated to cover incremental operating costs for project implementation and management including hiring local specialists to manage grant activities, enhancing domestic capacity by transferring knowledge through on-the-job training and workshops:. Component 2: Transaction and regulatory support. The component will support the GoSL in designing, structuring and negotiating an equitable agreement with a potential qualified geothermal developer; and will ensure a fair allocation of potential risks.  It will also help facilitate initial off-take arrangements with the power company that is essential for moving forward with potential investments.  The work will also help ensure that the legal and regulatory framework provides an adequate investment climate for a potential power project; and it will lead to the inclusion of geothermal as a part of LUCELEC’s formal expansion plans, providing the certainty for investing in exploration drilling. The project is expected to be completed by January 31, 2017.

The development objective of the project is to provide support for the Government of Saint Lucia to make an informed decision regarding geothermal exploration and development in Saint Lucia by undertaking upstream preparatory activities.  Such support would help the Government of Saint Lucia confirm areas for drilling, partner with a qualified developer, and design a geothermal exploration/resource confirmation program for sustainable implementation – all in line with good industry practices and international standards. The project will include the following components: Component 1: Upstream geothermal development preparation and project management.This component will aim at advancing surface level reconnaissance that is necessary to determine whether several areas identified maybe suitable for geothermal exploration within the Qualibou region.  It will also include a review of previous analysis such as geological, geophysical and geochemical surveys, as well as available data from previously drilled wells. The component will also initiate environmental and social evaluations, including stakeholder consultations, to ascertain baseline conditions and the steps that may be necessary to mitigate any impacts so that geothermal can be developed in a safe and sustainable manner. Funding will also be applied towards technical advisory support to coordinate the technical assessments and integrate the results in a pre-feasibility study. Funding will also be allocated to cover incremental operating costs for project implementation and management including hiring local specialists to manage grant activities, enhancing domestic capacity by transferring knowledge through on-the-job training and workshops:. Component 2: Transaction and regulatory support. The component will support the GoSL in designing, structuring and negotiating an equitable agreement with a potential qualified geothermal developer; and will ensure a fair allocation of potential risks.  It will also help facilitate initial off-take arrangements with the power company that is essential for moving forward with potential investments.  The work will also help ensure that the legal and regulatory framework provides an adequate investment climate for a potential power project; and it will lead to the inclusion of geothermal as a part of LUCELEC’s formal expansion plans, providing the certainty for investing in exploration drilling. The project is expected to be completed by January 31, 2017.

VI.3) Procedures for appeal VI.3.1) Body responsible for appeal procedures VI.3.2) Lodging of appeals Precise information on deadline(s) for lodging appeals: Utilities subject to the EC procurement legislation of England, Wales and Northern Ireland will incorporate a standstill period at the point information on the award of the contract is communicated to tenderers. That notification will provide full information on the award decision. The standstill period, which will be for a minimum of 10 calendar days, provides time for unsuccessful tenderers to challenge the award decision before the contract is entered into. The Utilities Contracts Regulations (SI 2005 No 6) provide for aggrieved parties who have been harmed or are at risk of harm by a breach of the rules to take action in the High Court (England, Wales and Northern Ireland). Any such action must be brought within 30 days of knowledge of any breach. Utilities subject to the EC procurement legislation of Scotland will where appropriate incorporate a minimum 10 calendar day standstill period (or 15 days if non electronic or fax methods used) at the point that information on the award of the contract is communicated to tenderers. If an appeal regarding the award of contract has not been successfully resolved then the Utilities Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2012 provide for aggrieved parties who have been harmed or are at risk of harm by a breach of the rule to take action in the Sheriff Court or Court of Session. Any such action must be brought within 30 days of knowledge of any breach.

Therefore Government of Georgia acting through the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development of Georgia invites local and international companies and Consortiums to submit their expressions of interest (“EOI’s”) to act as Investor in relation to the Project. The objective is to complete the development of the  port in  7 phases and upon the completion of the construction to reach 100 million ton annual turnover capacity. Georgia is the shortest route from Asia to Europe. It is part of the TRACECA corridor and home for ports of Batumi (liquid, dry bulk cargo and containers) operated through a wholly-owned subsidiary of JSC NC “KazMunayGas"", Supsa (owned by BP, oil terminal), Poti (dry bulk and containers) owned by APM Terminals and Kulevi (liquid cargo) owned by SOCAR.  Due to the ever-increasing trade between Europe and Asia, North and South, there is a need to construct a new deep water sea port with a capacity to accept vessels of at least 6,500 TEU capacity. The Government of Georgia will provide the Investor with up to one thousand (1000) hectares of land for the Project.

This contract is expected to help the Basrah provincial government attract high-quality international construction and project-management firms to execute the many infrastructure and development projects that are expected in the near future.   Iraq’s Provincial Powers Law allots a portion of Iraq’s national budget to each province of Iraq, based on its oil wealth.  Under this law, the Governorate of Basrah could have access to $14 billion in new funds for infrastructure projects, depending on how and when the 2014 national budget is approved.      U.S. firms interested in these upcoming major construction and development projects should pre-qualify with Hill International and check the Basrah governorate’s website (http://basra.gov.iq/ar/178/380/index.1.html) for announcements of specific opportunities, and apply for them using the process outlined below, which is subject to change in the future.  Hill International’s planning is currently divided into two tracks.  The first is a long-term city development plan, Basrah 2040, which envisions a major redevelopment and expansion of city infrastructure and resources over the next 25 years, to include whole new districts, residential and office areas, new universities, and other similarly large-scale projects.  The draft of this plan is expected to be presented to Basrah government officials at the end of 2014.  The first contracts related to the Basrah 2040 project, therefore, will not be issued for several years.  The second track consists of several groups of projects to improve Basrah’s current infrastructure in the near-to-medium term.  The first group, of about 40 projects, consists of roads, bridges, schools, hospitals, sewer projects, communications infrastructure, housing, parks, an entertainment city, and others.  These projects will total about $14 billion.  The second group will include more than 20 strategic projects, with budgets of $100 million or more; the third will consist of more than 600 smaller projects, with budgets between $10 to $50 million.  However, funding for these groups of projects will come from Iraq’s 2014 budget, which, as of July 2014, had not yet been approved.  Therefore, although planning has begun, most of these projects are on hold.   The Basrah governorate and Hill International will probably move quickly to implement them once the budget has passed.    However, there are about 14 smaller projects, totaling about $3 billion, that will begin in the near future, with contracts to be signed in the summer of 2014 and implementation to take place in late 2014 and early 2015.  These include roads and other infrastructure projects, including a redesign of Basrah’s iconic Corniche and refurbishment of its city canals.  As of early July 2014, these projects are posted at the Basrah Governorate’s procurement website:  (http://basra.gov.iq/ar/178/380/index.1.html)   ",Construction;Infrastructure,Post Identified Project,2013-11-29,2015-01-01,Government,None,Hill International,Lonnie Kelley,,Lonnie Kelley,KelleyL@state.gov,http://basra.gov.iq/ar/178/380/index.1.html) ,http://iraq.usembassy.gov/business.html,,,1,Pipeline,0,POINT (5322927.021871534 3567983.4559358195),"<div class=""popupLead""><div class=""popupLeadTitle"">Tender Pre-qualification and Selection Process Hill International Contract with Basra Governate Summer 2014</div><div class=""popupLeadDetails""><b>Country: </b>Iraq<br><b>Sector: </b>Construction<br><b>Date Added: </b>2014-07-23<br><b>Primary Funding Source: </b>Government<br><b>Project Size (USD): </b>14000000000<br><b>Status: </b>Pipeline<br><br><b>Description: </b><br>In November 2013, U.S. project management company Hill International signed a three-year contract to oversee development planning and provincial procurement for the Basrah governorate.
